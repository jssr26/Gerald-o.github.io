				<H1> Stools </H1>
				<p> The stool is an important type of chair! Stools are historically one of the most useful types of furniture in the world. Those who ignore the stool risk 
				 missing out on a great piece of furniture. As the chair connoisseurs we believe that stools are one  the best quality and the most affordable type of chairs. The stool is one of the earliest
				forms of seat furniture. It is very similar to a chair but it usually is without back or armrests 
				and sits on a base of either three or four legs. Some modern stools have backs and are more comfortable for those looking for luxury.For those looking for  practical and stylish sitting furniture the stool is the way to go !
